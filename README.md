hi, so i am going to elaborate on the given questions with the blend of a technical and non-technical terms to make it a pleasent experience. :D

An explanation of how you scraped the data- the data was scraped on the basis of users residing in Moscow, Russia with more than 50 followers

The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data- Two interesting anecdotes in my opinion were that the two most popular programming languages, JavaScript and Python both are Object-Oriented Programming laguages and most of the users work for Yandex which is a company native to Russia, their motherland.

An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis- The most followed github users from Moscow rarely follow anyone, but i believe doing so creates a huge opportunity for collobration and sharing of ideas which is the very essence of Github.

Have a lovely day :)
